      <description>I met Lauren Lee at RubyConf 2017 in New Orleans and I&amp;rsquo;ve been so impressed with her ever since. She&amp;rsquo;s started a podcast called &amp;ldquo;We Belong Here&amp;rdquo;. She&amp;rsquo;s detailing stories of unconventional journeys in tech.
Lauren and I sat down and talked about my journey in tech—how I went from creating Wordpress sites for schools to leading an engineering team at a national education organization. Take a listen here!</description>

      <description>The idea Last night, Ruby in Hollywood held its first ever Capture the Flag event. Jake Wilkins had the idea for us to attack OWASP Juice Shop, which is a node.js app full of security vulnerabilities. I did some research about CTFs and thought it sounded like a great idea. I sent around this video from UCSB&amp;rsquo;s white hat team to all Ruby in Hollywood members so they could prepare.</description>

      <description>Wonderful world of ReactJS Last night, Ruby in Hollywood held a special event in conjunction with the General Assembly Alumni Guild.
We had a great mix of aspiring and current Rubyists, along with a good representation of General Assembly Grads from Cohort 9.
We kicked off the evening with pizza and beer, and some good conversation.
