      <description>Last night I got a very bad, no good email from Goodreads.
It read:
 Your Goodreads developer API key has been deactivated
Goodreads has deactivated the Goodreads developer API key associated with your Goodreads account as it has not been used in more than 30 days. As of December 8th 2020, Goodreads will no longer issue new developer keys for our public developer API and plans to retire these tools.</description>
