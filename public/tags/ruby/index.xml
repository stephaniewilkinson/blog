      <description>Last night I got a very bad, no good email from Goodreads.
It read:
 Your Goodreads developer API key has been deactivated
Goodreads has deactivated the Goodreads developer API key associated with your Goodreads account as it has not been used in more than 30 days. As of December 8th 2020, Goodreads will no longer issue new developer keys for our public developer API and plans to retire these tools.</description>

      <description>Wonderful world of ReactJS Last night, Ruby in Hollywood held a special event in conjunction with the General Assembly Alumni Guild.
We had a great mix of aspiring and current Rubyists, along with a good representation of General Assembly Grads from Cohort 9.
We kicked off the evening with pizza and beer, and some good conversation.
